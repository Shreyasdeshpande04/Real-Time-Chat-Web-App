HELLO GUYS, I am Shreyas Deshpande.

I have done a Real time Chat web app project using web languages like- HTML, CSS ,JS , PHP & etc. This project is a part of a internship which i am doing at InternshipMela. I have used my knowledge of Full stack web development & applied it during completion of this project. And finally got output succesfully. I have attached screenshot of output in the repository.

Steps to use:- Download all files from this repository.Unzip all files. Save it in a single folder. Open Xampp server. Then start Apache and Mysql module. Open Chrome and type -localhost/realtimechatapplication in address bar to view output.

Hope you will use and like it !!!
